# Helix Parallelism: Breaking the Latency-Throughput Wall of Ultra-Long LLM Decoding

## TL;DR

**Helix Parallelism schedules Attention and FFN with different parallelism strategies to eliminate KV cache duplication and FFN weight load bottlenecks—reducing token latency by up to 1.5× for 1M-token contexts and increasing concurrent user capacity by up to 32× under the same latency budget.**



## Core Idea

> **2-D Sharding + Communication Hiding**
> During the Attention phase, Helix applies *KV Parallelism* (sequence-wise) × *Tensor Parallelism* (head-wise) to achieve **0% KV duplication**.
> Then, the same GPU pool is reshaped into *Tensor(×Expert) Parallelism* for the FFN phase to **distribute weight loading evenly**.
> All-to-All communication between these two phases is overlapped using a **HOP-B pipeline**, minimizing exposed latency.

## Background: The Problem They Solved

When serving large LLMs in "real-time", two bottlenecks arise simultaneously:

| Bottleneck            | Cause                                                                 | Prior Solutions | Limitation                                       |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **KV Cache Duplication** | If TP degree > number of KV heads K, each GPU must replicate the entire KV cache | TP, PP         | DRAM traffic and memory usage surge → Latency plateau |
| **FFN Weight Loading**   | With KV cache sharded (e.g., via KVP), FFN computation gets stuck on a few GPUs | KVP (e.g., Medha) | Solves KV, but FFN dominates the tail of TTL     |

Ultimately, existing methods were stuck in a trade-off:  
**"Shard KV → FFN bottlenecks, shard FFN → KV duplicates."**



## New Approach: **Helix Parallelism**

Helix divides time within a single layer:

1. **Attention Phase** — `KV Parallelism (sequence)` × `Tensor Parallelism (head)`
   - FlashAttention is performed per KV slice
   - Each slice outputs **Oᵢ** and **log-sum-exp LSEᵢ**
   - Final softmax is restored using:

     $$
     O = \frac{\sum_i O_i\,e^{\text{LSE}_i}}{\sum_i e^{\text{LSE}_i}}
     $$

2. **FFN Phase** — The same GPU pool is **reshaped into TP (×EP)** layout
   - All-to-All followed by 32-way GEMM, then All-Reduce

3. **HOP-B** — All-to-All for token *t* is overlapped with FlashAttention of token *t+1*
   - Exposed communication ≤ 12% of TTL


## How It Works: A Concrete Example

> **Llama-3 70B** | **32 × H100 GPUs** (within a single NVLink node)  
> Q-heads = 64, KV-heads K = 8 → **8 TP × 4 KVP = 32 GPUs**

```

KVP Rows   TP Cols → 0 … 7       (Total 32 GPUs)
Row 0      G0  G1 … G7     (tokens 0 to S/4−1)
Row 1      G8  G9 … G15    (tokens S/4 to S/2−1)
Row 2      G16 G17 … G23   (tokens S/2 to 3S/4−1)
Row 3      G24 G25 … G31   (tokens 3S/4 to S−1)

```

*KV duplication = 0%, KV cache/GPU ≈ 0.3 GB*

### One Token Flow:

1. **GPU G<sub>r,c</sub>** runs FlashAttention over its own KV slice → produces (Oᵢ, LSEᵢ)
2. **All-to-All #1**: exchange partial outputs across query-head axis
3. Final softmax is reconstructed from the formula above
4. **Layout switch** — All-to-All #2 reshuffles to TP-aligned layout
5. **32-way TP FFN** → All-Reduce #3 aggregates the results
6. **HOP-B** — step #1 for token *t+1* overlaps with All-to-All of token *t*

*Measured (1M context)*  
TTL **9.7 ms** (vs 11 ms), tok/s/GPU **360** (vs 90),  
Concurrent batch capacity increases **4×**.

## Performance Evaluation: Key Results

| Model                  | HW Setup | TTL ↓       | Batch/Throughput ↑ |
|------------------------|----------|-------------|---------------------|
| DeepSeek-R1 671B MoE   | 72 GPUs  | **1.5× ↓**  | **32× ↑**           |
| Llama-405B Dense       | 72 GPUs  | **1.13× ↓** | **4× ↑**            |
| Llama-3 70B (Inference)| 32 GPUs  | **1.13× ↓** | **4× ↑**            |

*Helix points consistently outperform the Pareto frontier defined by TP/KVP/PP baselines.*



## Our Perspective: Strengths, Limitations, and Why It Matters

### Strengths

- **Dual Bottleneck Resolution** — Eliminates KV duplication while evenly distributing FFN weight load.
- **Communication Volume Constantized** — All-to-All traffic is independent of context length *S*, scaling to 1M+ tokens.
- **Precision- and Model-Agnostic** — Fully compatible with FP4/FP8, GQA, MLA, MoE, etc.

### Limitations

- **Assumes Single NVLink Node** — In multi-node or InfiniBand setups, communication hiding becomes less effective.
- **Small Contexts / Small GPU Pools** — When *G ≤ K*, Helix offers limited gains.
- **No Quality or Energy Analysis** — FP4 numerical stability and J·token⁻¹ metrics are not evaluated.

### Why It Matters

Real-world LLM services demand **low latency + high concurrency**.  
Helix breaks the existing “KV duplication vs FFN bottleneck” trade-off, enabling large-scale LLMs to be served interactively, with much better throughput and latency balance.

## What’s Next?: Future Directions

1. **Integrate Sparse Attention (e.g., NSA)** — May cut KV bandwidth by an additional 50%.
2. **Multi-node Helix** — Extend to cluster scale with topology-aware All-to-All.
3. **Adaptive Scheduler** — Dynamically switch between Helix and traditional TP based on real-time KV/FFN workload balance.
4. **Precision & Quality Evaluation** — Validate softmax rescaling stability under FP4/FP8; test for drift and robustness.
5. **Energy & Cost Metrics** — Report J·token⁻¹ and $/million tokens to show realistic ROI.

Helix completes a critical piece of the “real-time LLM serving” puzzle.  
The remaining pieces—**distributed topology, sparse computation, and energy efficiency**—will turn *million-context* LLMs into everyday deployable technology.

## Prompt 1.1.1 — Research Gap

> Analyze the 'Introduction' and 'Related Work' sections to identify the explicit research gap this study aims to fill, the key limitations of existing approaches, and the state of the art at the time of publication.

### Key Conclusion (One-liner)

**Existing parallelism methods for ultra-long (≥ 10⁶ tokens) LLM decoding fail to address KV cache duplication and FFN weight-loading bottlenecks simultaneously. Helix Parallelism overcomes both by temporally separating and restructuring the Attention and FFN phases—achieving up to 1.5× lower TTL and 32× higher batch capacity.**



### 1. Unresolved Problems in Prior Work

| Prior Approach                                        | Core Limitation                                                                   | Resulting Bottleneck                                   |
|------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| **Tensor Parallelism (TP)**                          | When TP width > K, each GPU must replicate full KV cache                         | DRAM bandwidth/memory bloat → Latency plateau          |
| **KV Parallelism (Medha)**                           | KV is sequence-sharded, but FFN runs on a fixed, small TP group (e.g., 8 GPUs)   | FFN weight load dominates TTL tail                     |
| **Sequence/Context Parallelism in training (e.g., USP, LoongServe)** | Ignores causality + real-time TTL in decoding                                   | Not effective for inference with long contexts         |

→ Thus:

> *“In real-time, ultra-long context decoding, where both KV and FFN become dominant bottlenecks, there is no method to dynamically reshape parallelism per phase.”*

Helix Parallelism directly addresses this **dual bottleneck problem**.



### 2. State of the Art at Time of Publication

* **Model/Hardware Context**
  - Modern LLMs use GQA/MQA/MLA ⇒ KV heads *K* ≪ Q-heads *Q* (e.g., Q = 128, K = 8)
  - NVIDIA GB200 NVL72-class GPUs with FP4 and high NVLink bandwidth

* **Dominant Parallelism Combinations**
  1. **TP (≤ K)**: no KV duplication, but limited parallelism → FFN bottleneck
  2. **TP (> K)**: higher parallelism but KV cache is duplicated *K* times
  3. **TP + PP + EP**: efficient for prefill, limited TTL gains during decoding
  4. **Medha-style KVP**: sequence-sharded KV reduces DRAM reads,  
     → But FFN still centralized on K GPUs → load imbalance

* **Example Limits**
  - When TP > K, KV cache duplication plateaus performance.
  - In Medha+Blackwell, KV duplication is solved, but FFN loading still dominates >50% of TTL (e.g., DeepSeek-R1 MoE).



### Helix’s Claimed Improvements (Numerical Summary)

| Model                        | TTL Reduction | Batch Capacity ↑ | Tokens/sec/GPU ↑          |
|-----------------------------|----------------|------------------|----------------------------|
| **DeepSeek-R1 (671B MoE)**  | **1.5× ↓**     | **32× ↑**        | N/A (same TTL, higher B)  |
| **Llama-405B (Dense)**      | **1.13× ↓**    | 4× ↑             | 4× ↑                      |

> In short, Helix pushes past the SOTA frontier by sharding KV via KVP while **reconfiguring the same GPU pool** for FFN using TP(×EP), forming a temporal 2-phase pipeline.



**Summary**: Existing TP/KVP models solve either KV duplication or FFN load—but not both.  
Helix Parallelism introduces per-phase sharding strategies to **overcome both simultaneously**, achieving real-time LLM inference even with million-token contexts.

## Prompt 1.2.2 — Author's Perspective on Strengths

> Why do the authors believe their method is superior to prior work?

**Summary** | The authors claim that Helix Parallelism breaks through the “dual bottlenecks” of KV cache duplication and FFN weight loading by applying phase-wise customized sharding and communication hiding (HOP-B), achieving up to 1.5× lower latency and 32× more concurrent users.

### Additional Evidence (from text)

- **Memory-independent All-to-All traffic**: proportional to B·H, not sequence length S → scales to 1M+ tokens
- **Compatible with modern GPU features**: FP4, GQA, MLA, MoE, NVLink bandwidth
- **Medha vs Helix**: Medha still bottlenecks on FFN even after solving KV

> The key strength emphasized is that Helix temporally separates Attention (memory-bound) and FFN (compute-bound) phases, and applies phase-specific parallelism to optimize both.

|----------|---------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **① Attention** (TP ≤ K, KVP > 1) | `TP` splits heads, `KVP` splits sequence → `G = TP × KVP` | 1. All GPUs compute QKV projection → each holds its KV slice (S/KVP)<br>2. FlashAttention per slice → produces Oᵢ and LSEᵢ<br>3. **All-to-All #1** across query heads<br>4. Rescaling with softmax formula for exact output |
| **② HOP-B**                     | same layout                                            | Overlaps All-to-All of token *t* with FlashAttention of token *t+1* → hides communication time                                                                                                                                    |

→ KV read ∝ S/KVP, FFN load ∝ 1/G → both bottlenecks are mitigated.


### 3. Toy Example Walkthrough (B = 1, S = 4, Q = 4, K = 2, H = 6, G = 2)

> 2 GPUs, TP = 2, KVP = 1

- Input query vector: **q = [1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1]**
- KV cache (4×6): GPU0 holds tokens 0–1, GPU1 holds tokens 2–3

| GPU | KV slice    | ① dot(q, K) = α | ② softmax(α)     | ③ α · V → o_partial            |
|------|-------------|------------------|-------------------|-------------------------------|
| 0    | tokens 0–1  | [3, 2]           | [0.73, 0.27]      | 0.73·v₀ + 0.27·v₁             |
| 1    | tokens 2–3  | [1, 4]           | [0.12, 0.88]      | 0.12·v₂ + 0.88·v₃             |

- **All-to-All** exchanges o_partial and LSE
- Final **o_final** is reconstructed using the formula

**HOP-B** overlaps token *t* communication with token *t+1* computation.

**FFN Phase**:
- All-to-All reshapes hidden vector (dim 6): GPU0 gets dims 0–2, GPU1 gets dims 3–5
- Each runs FFN (W₁·h + b → GeLU → W₂·…) → then **All-Reduce**
- Final hidden vector **h′** is produced

This process is repeated every token, keeping KV duplication at 0% and FFN load balanced.


### 4. Key Results Summary

| Model                    | G   | TTL ↓         | Batch ↑         | Notes   |
|--------------------------|-----|---------------|------------------|---------|

| Llama-405B (Dense)       | 72  | **1.13× ↓**   | **4× TPS/GPU ↑** |         |


### Key Takeaways

1. **2-D Sharding**: TP (head) × KVP (sequence) removes KV duplication plateau.
2. **GPU Reuse**: Attention → FFN reshaping allows for full GPU utilization.
3. **HOP-B**: Hides communication in parallel with compute; reduces visible latency to ≤12%.
4. **Result**: Extends the latency-throughput Pareto frontier for ultra-long context LLMs.

## Prompt 1.3.2 — The “Secret Weapon”

> Identify the single most critical formula, algorithm step, or architectural element enabling the paper’s main contribution.

### Summary First

The **"secret weapon"** of Helix is the LSE-based rescaling of partial Attention outputs from each KV slice:

$$
\boxed{\;O=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N} O_i\,e^{\text{LSE}_i}}{\sum_{i=1}^{N} e^{\text{LSE}_i}}\;}
$$

This exact rescaling, performed after a **single All-to-All communication round**, enables Helix’s `KVP × TP` 2-D sharding while preserving numerical correctness.


### 1. What does it do?

| Step               | Description                                                                                   | Result                                                |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| **① Per-KVP GPU**  | Runs FlashAttention on its KV slice (S/KVP) → emits **Oᵢ**, **LSEᵢ**                         | Memory-local compute, no KV duplication               |
| **② All-to-All**   | Exchange Oᵢ and LSEᵢ across query-head dimension                                              | Traffic ∝ B·H, independent of sequence length S       |
| **③ Rescaling**    | Use the above formula to reconstruct final softmax output exactly                             | Bitwise equivalent to single-GPU computation          |
| **④ Layout Switch**| After rescaling, output is already in TP layout → ready for FFN phase                         | Enables immediate FFN parallelism                     |


### 2. Why is it essential?

1. **Eliminates KV Duplication**
   - Even if TP > K, no KV replication needed → avoids DRAM/memory bottleneck

2. **Constant-Time Communication**
   - All-to-All cost is independent of context length S; latency hidden via HOP-B

3. **Enables GPU Reuse**
   - Output already TP-aligned → immediate transition to FFN phase without reshuffling

4. **Numerical Stability**
   - Fully reconstructs softmax normalization without approximation, even at FP4/FP8

> In short: this LSE-based partial output recombination is what **makes Helix's dual sharding + GPU reuse architecture possible**—without it, the approach collapses.


## Prompt 1.4.1 — Key Results with Metrics

> Analyze key results from the paper. What metrics were used? What benchmarks? What results do the authors highlight most?

### TL;DR

**Helix Parallelism** pushes the latency-throughput Pareto frontier outward:  
It reduces TTL by **1.5×** for DeepSeek-R1 and **1.13×** for Llama-405B,  
while enabling **32×** and **4×** more concurrent users respectively under the same latency constraint.

### 1. Key Evaluation Metrics

| Metric                       | Definition                                                      | Purpose                     |
|------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| **TTL**                      | Token-to-token latency                                          | Real-time responsiveness    |
| **Throughput per GPU**       | Tokens generated per second per GPU                             | Resource efficiency         |
| **Batch Scalability**        | Number of concurrent sequences that can be processed at target TTL | Scalability for large services |

### 3. Summary Table of Core Results

| Model            | Metric               | Baseline Best | **Helix** | Gain            |
|------------------|----------------------|----------------|-----------|-----------------|
| DeepSeek-R1      | TTL (↓)              | 1.0×           | **0.67×** | **1.5× ↓**      |
|                  | Batch Capacity (↑)   | 1×             | **32×**   | **32× ↑**       |
| Llama-405B       | TTL (↓)              | 1.0×           | **0.88×** | **1.13× ↓**     |
|                  | TPS/GPU (↑)          | 1×             | **4×**    | **4× ↑**        |

> Interpretation: Helix avoids both KV duplication and FFN bottlenecks, thus dominating the prior Pareto frontier.


### 4. HOP-B Ablation (Communication Hiding Effect)

| Model        | HOP-B OFF   | HOP-B ON       | TTL Reduction |
|--------------|-------------|----------------|----------------|
| DeepSeek-R1  | TTL ↓ 1%    | —              | Small effect   |
| Llama-405B   | TTL ↓ 12%   | —              | Significant gain |

HOP-B overlaps token communication with computation, recovering up to 12% TTL.


### 5. Key Takeaways from Results

- Helix **outperforms all prior sharding combinations** on simulated 1M-token settings
- Throughput ↑, TTL ↓ — a rare simultaneous win
- Communication cost stays low even with growing context due to B·H-scaling All-to-All

## Prompt 1.4.2 — Critical Comparison

> How does Helix perform compared to baseline and SOTA methods? Are there cases where it doesn’t outperform others?

### Conclusion in One Line

**Helix outperforms existing SOTA methods like Medha KVP and TP/PP/EP combinations on both latency and throughput, especially in large-scale, long-context decoding. However, its advantage shrinks in low-GPU or short-context settings.**


| Model (1M ctx)                   | Baseline Compared                | TTL ↓        | Batch/TPS ↑      | Author’s Claimed Edge                             |
|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|--------------|------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| DeepSeek-R1 (671B, 72 GPUs)      | Medha KVP + TP(K=8)              | **1.5× ↓**   | **32× ↑**        | Solves both KV duplication and FFN load imbalance |
|                                  | Best TP only (K=8)               | >**1.8× ↓**  | **32× ↑**        | Allows TP > K without KV duplication              |
| Llama-405B (Dense, G=72)         | Medha + TP(=8)                   | **1.13× ↓**  | **4× ↑**         | Avoids KV duplication even with TP > K            |
|                                  | Pipeline Parallel (8-stage)      | >**1.3× ↓**  | 2–3× ↑           | PP increases TTL during decoding                  |

> 📌 Strongest claim: DeepSeek-R1 runs 32× more users concurrently with 1.5× faster latency than the best baseline (Figure 5).


### When Helix Doesn’t Win

| Observation                              | Helix ≤ Baseline              | Author's Explanation                                 |
|------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| **Prefill phase**                        | TP + PP slightly faster       | KV cache is short, FFN load dominates → Helix less effective |
| **Small GPU pool (G ≤ K)**               | TP alone is optimal           | No KV duplication occurs anyway                     |
| **Communication-light models (e.g. DeepSeek)** | HOP-B ON vs OFF: ≤ 1% TTL gain | FFN dominates, little communication to hide         |

Authors emphasize: Helix excels **only when KV duplication + FFN bottlenecks coexist**.  
If *G ≤ K* or *context is short*, traditional TP/KVP may suffice.


### Summary

1. Helix dominates in **large-scale, long-context decoding** (S ≥ 1M, G ≫ K)
2. In small-scale or short-context scenarios, gains diminish
3. Therefore, Helix is **not a one-size-fits-all**, but a specialized tool for large-service inference

> Bottom line: Helix shines when both memory (KV) and compute (FFN) become bottlenecks. In simpler regimes, classic TP/PP still hold their ground.


## Prompt 1.5.1 — Limitations (Acknowledged & Potential)

> What limitations do the authors acknowledge, and what are some others they didn’t mention?

### Summary in One Line

Helix removes the KV–FFN bottlenecks cleanly—but it’s heavily dependent on **single-node GB200-class GPUs with million-token contexts**, and lacks coverage in multi-node, sparse attention, or quality/energy evaluation.


### 1. Limitations Acknowledged by Authors

| Type                    | Description                                                                                      |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Simulation only**     | All results use a simulator modeled on NVIDIA GB200 NVL72 → may not match real-world HW exactly |
| **Models lack native 1M ctx** | DeepSeek-R1 and Llama-405B don’t yet support million-token natively, only assumed during testing |
| **Short context, small GPU pool** | For S < 4k or G ≤ K, Helix often converges to traditional TP-like behavior               |
| **Low communication settings** | e.g., DeepSeek-R1 → HOP-B makes ≤1% difference                                             |
| **Sparse Attention not supported** | NSA and similar methods are left as future work                                          |


### 2. Additional Potential Limitations (Unacknowledged)

| Concern                           | Description                                                                                             |
|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Single-node assumption**       | Multi-node All-to-All may reduce HOP-B effectiveness due to inter-node latency                          |
| **Hardware specificity**         | GB200’s FP4 & NVLink bandwidth are assumed; performance may degrade on PCIe or older GPUs               |
| **Runtime layout switching cost**| Token-level reshaping (KVP ↔ TP×EP) requires dynamic memory & communication topology switching           |
| **Numerical stability (FP4)**    | No analysis of LSE overflow/underflow risks, especially in long sequences with FP4 precision             |
| **Lack of quality eval**         | No perplexity or BLEU reported; inference quality under FP4 and recombined softmax remains untested     |
| **Energy & carbon impact**       | Power draw for 72 GPUs may be high; no energy-per-token or carbon efficiency reported                    |


### Summary Takeaways

- Helix targets “**G ≫ K**, **S ≥ 1M**, **NVLink-class single node**” as its ideal scenario.
- Sparse Attention, multi-node, precision robustness, and deployment cost/quality are all open areas.
- Before deploying Helix, verify whether **your workload actually faces both KV and FFN bottlenecks**.

## Prompt 1.5.2 — Future Research Directions

> What future work do the authors suggest? What other logical next steps arise from the limitations?

### Summary — At a Glance

The authors primarily propose integrating **Natively Sparse Attention (NSA)** into Helix and extending it into a **unified runtime across all context lengths**.  
Based on the paper’s limitations, we also identify six additional research directions needed for real-world deployment.


### 1. Explicit Future Work by Authors

| ID    | Proposed Direction                                                            | Expected Benefit                                                                 |
|-------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| A1    | **Support Sparse Attention (e.g., NSA)**                                       | Further reduce KV bandwidth (up to −50%) while preserving 2D sharding structure |
| A2    | **Unified Runtime across all context lengths (short to long)**                | Simplifies runtime logic by avoiding context-based switching                    |

> These are the only two “Future Work” directions explicitly listed by the authors.


### 2. Additional Research Directions (Derived from Limitations)

| Limitation                         | Suggested Future Work                                                                                         | Why It Matters                                                                 |
|-----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Single-node assumption            | **B1. Multi-node Helix**: redesign All-to-All using topology-aware schemes for NVSwitch, PCIe, RDMA           | Most deployments span racks/clusters; NVLink-only is unrealistic               |
| Variable KV/FFN ratio             | **B2. Adaptive Layout Scheduler**: dynamically switch between Helix and traditional TP                        | Avoid Helix overhead when its benefits are marginal (e.g., small S, low G)     |
| FP4 numerical risk                | **B3. Mixed-precision eval**: include FP8/BF16; evaluate PPL, BLEU, drift                                     | Softmax rescaling might underflow or overflow in low-precision                 |
| Energy cost unmeasured            | **B4. J/token-aware Helix**: report Wh/token, CO₂eq                                                            | 72-GPU deployment likely consumes massive energy; ROI must include cost        |
| HBM-only KV cache assumption      | **B5. Hierarchical KV Caching + Helix**: enable GPU↔CPU↔NVM tiered caching with prefetch support              | Scaling to 10⁷ tokens will exceed HBM capacity                                 |
| No output quality comparison      | **B6. Robustness & Alignment Testing**: verify if Helix decoding matches TP output or introduces drift        | Bitwise differences may impact generation quality; no evaluation is present    |



### 3. Final Takeaways

- The authors' stated goals (A1, A2) focus on expanding Helix to cover **sparse attention and runtime unification**.
- For practical deployment, the next steps must address:
  - **Inter-node scalability**
  - **Energy/precision robustness**
  - **Adaptive dynamic scheduling**
  - **Memory hierarchy beyond HBM**
  - **Output quality preservation**
