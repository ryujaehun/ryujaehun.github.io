# K-Beauty: Poised for a New Leap Forward

The K-beauty industry has recently been capturing the spotlight once again. As an investor looking into the sector, I feel that this industry is not just following a fleeting trend but is facing a period of serious structural transformation. In the past, there was a high dependency on China, but now the export market is rapidly expanding to the United States, Japan, Europe, the Middle East, and Southeast Asia. The role of technology-driven brands and Original Design Manufacturing (ODM) companies has become more critical than ever.

This shift involves more than just diversifying export destinations; it accompanies a paradigm shift in product essence and consumer perception. Consumers now choose cosmetics based on more specific and scientific criteria such as ingredients, efficacy, safety, and sustainability, rather than just brand image. As a result, the beauty industry is gradually approaching the boundary of the healthcare and wellness sectors, presenting both a challenge and an opportunity for K-beauty companies.

## 🌍 K-Beauty's Expansion Strategy: Moving Beyond China

Just a few years ago, K-beauty was largely dependent on the Chinese market. However, following the THAAD incident in 2017, the growth in the Chinese market slowed due to government regulations, an unofficial boycott sentiment, and the rapid rise of local Chinese brands. In response, Korean cosmetics companies strategically began to diversify their export markets, a strategy that is now yielding visible results.

As of 2024, the United States has emerged as the largest export destination for Korean cosmetics, with market share steadily increasing in Japan, Europe, the Middle East, and Southeast Asia as well. This trend is not merely a geographical diversification but a **strategic pivot to adapt to the needs of global consumers**. This demands precise product planning tailored to regional consumer characteristics: American consumers are sensitive to ingredients and efficacy, Japanese consumers value functionality and simplicity, Europeans prioritize sustainability and eco-friendliness, and Middle Eastern consumers focus on luxury and Halal certification.

Distribution methods are also evolving. While department store-centric distribution was dominant in the past, digital platforms like Amazon, Qoo10, TikTok, and Olive Young have now become core channels. This provides global expansion opportunities for emerging brands and SMEs, enabling them to build a loyal customer base through Direct-to-Consumer (D2C) communication.

### 📌 Summary of Export Share Changes

| Export Destination | 2016 Share (Approx. %) | 2024 Share (Approx. %) | Key Change Factors                                                                                  |

## 🔬 From Brands to Technology: A Shift in Industry Leadership

K-beauty is transforming from an industry of 'brands that make you look pretty' to one centered on 'technological capabilities with scientifically proven efficacy.' This phenomenon arises as consumer perceptions of beauty shift towards health and wellness. In response, both domestic and international companies are actively strengthening their research and development (R\&D).

  * **APR (APR Corp)**: Pioneering the home beauty device market with its AGE-R device, APR is building a 'device-cosmetic ecosystem' by linking it with its Medicube cosmetics. Its customer lock-in strategy is outstanding, and it is rapidly expanding its market share in the US, Japan, and Singapore.
  * **Cosmax**: Going beyond simple manufacturing, Cosmax is elevating the ODM industry by developing new technology-based ingredients, optimizing formulations with AI, and implementing a globally distributed production strategy. Active collaboration with indie brands, in particular, has created a foundation for more brands to enter the market quickly.

Furthermore, with the rapid rise of derma-cosmetic brands based on dermatology and the strengthening trend of purchasing based on specific ingredients like PDRN, microbiome, retinol, and peptides, the 'function-centric skincare' market is moving to the forefront. K-beauty is recognized as one of the sectors that best reflects this trend, instilling the perception of 'science-based cosmetics' in consumers worldwide.

## 📊 K-Beauty Companies from an Investor's Perspective

While studying the industry, looking at related companies from an investment standpoint is also an interesting approach. The cosmetics industry was traditionally considered a cyclical consumer good, but it is recently being re-evaluated as an investment theme as it merges with device, bio, and healthcare elements.

### 📈 Key Company Comparison Summary

| Company          | Market Cap (Approx.) | 2024 Revenue Growth | Operating Profit Margin | Overseas Sales % | Features & Investment Points                                                         |
| :--------------- | :------------------- | :------------------ | :---------------------- | :--------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Amorepacific** | KRW 8.0 Trillion     | +5.9%               | 5.8%                    | 44%              | Turnaround expectations, expanding North American sales, brand renewal in progress.  |
| **APR Corp**     | KRW 5.9 Trillion     | +38.0%              | 17.0%                   | 55%              | Device + cosmetics ecosystem, global expansion based on D2C model.                   |
| **LG H\&H**      | KRW 5.0 Trillion     | -                   | -                       | -                | Luxury-focused, in the early stages of renewal, China risk remains.                  |
| **Cosmax**       | KRW 2.7 Trillion     | +21.9%              | 8.1%                    | 46%              | Growth based on indie brands, leading the ODM ecosystem, expanding global factories. |
*Data as of July 2025. Financials are based on FY2024 results. Market cap is subject to change.*

Notably, technology-focused companies like APR are maximizing customer lifetime value by adopting a hardware + consumables model, while Cosmax is being evaluated as playing a 'TSMC-like role' in the cosmetics industry. Meanwhile, although LG Household & Health Care and Amorepacific still have high exposure to China and duty-free channels, they are seeking new growth opportunities through restructuring.
